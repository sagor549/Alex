### Indicators Used and Their Ranges

1. **Crop Health (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)**:

   - **Purpose**: Measures vegetation health and density.
   - **Typical Range**: -1 to 1
     - **Interpretation**:
       - Values close to 1 indicate dense, healthy vegetation (e.g., forests, crops).
       - Values around 0 suggest barren or sparse vegetation (e.g., urban areas, rock surfaces).
       - Negative values indicate water, snow, or clouds.

2. **Water Stress (Normalized Difference Water Index)**:

   - **Purpose**: Assesses water content in vegetation and soil.
   - **Typical Range**: -1 to 1
     - **Interpretation**:
       - Positive values usually indicate high water content in vegetation.
       - Values near 0 or negative suggest low moisture content, possibly indicating drought conditions or non-vegetated surfaces.

3. **Plant Humidity (Normalized Difference Moisture Index)**:

   - **Purpose**: Evaluates vegetation moisture content.
   - **Typical Range**: -1 to 1
     - **Interpretation**:
       - Values closer to 1 indicate higher moisture levels in the vegetation.
       - Near-zero values indicate moderate to low moisture content.
       - Negative values may indicate dry conditions or non-vegetated areas.

4. **Ground temperature (Ground  Temperature)**:
   - **Purpose**: Measures surface temperature, influencing plant stress.
   - **Typical Range**: Varies widely based on geographic and climatic conditions, commonly:
     - Ranges from below 250 Kelvin (cold areas) to above 320 Kelvin (hot desert regions).
     - **Interpretation**:
       - High Ground temperature can indicate stress conditions for plants (e.g., heat stress).
       - Low Ground temperature is typical in cooler climates or during nighttime.

### Atmospheric Parameters and Their Typical Ranges

1. **Atmospheric NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide Concentration)**:

   - **Purpose**: Indicator of air quality, often from combustion processes.
   - **Typical Range** (in parts per million, ppm): 0 to 0.1 ppm in typical environments.
     - **Interpretation**:
       - Low concentrations indicate cleaner air.
       - Higher concentrations can indicate polluted conditions.

2. **Atmospheric O3 (Ozone Concentration)**:

   - **Purpose**: An important factor in atmospheric chemistry, affecting air quality.
   - **Typical Range** (in parts per million, ppm): 0.02 to 0.1 ppm for ground-level ozone.
     - **Interpretation**:
       - Moderate levels may slightly affect sensitive plants.
       - High levels can be harmful to both human health and plant life.

3. **Atmospheric SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide Concentration)**:
   - **Purpose**: Generally a result of industrial activity; can affect plant health.
   - **Typical Range** (in parts per million, ppm): 0 to 0.05 ppm in most environments.
     - **Interpretation**:
       - Low or zero levels are ideal.
       - Elevated levels can be harmful to vegetation and human health.

Understanding these Indicators and their ranges helps interpret environmental data accurately, guiding decision-making in agricultural management and environmental conservation.
